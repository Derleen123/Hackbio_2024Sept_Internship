# Proteins: Drug Targets in Cancer Treatment

Proteins are important targets for cancer drugs because proteins are implicated in nearly every cellular process and disease mechanism. Many genetic mutations ultimately cause cancer by altering protein function and, therefore, the aberrant protein becomes an ideal target for the treatment of cancer. (Kumar et al., 2021).

Several therapies target these aberrant proteins so as to address the molecular causes of cancer with minimal toxicity to healthy cells (Hu et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2019). Examples of therapies targeting these aberrant proteins have pointed to a number of key classes of proteins that represent potential targets:

1. **Kinases** - Enzymes involved in cell signaling and their activity is higher in cancerous cells than in normal cells. An example includes imatinib works by targeting the BCR-ABL fusion protein in chronic myeloid leukemia and successfully inhibits the leukemic cells from uncontrollable proliferation (Ventura et al., 2006).

2. **Growth Factor Receptors** - These proteins are highly expressed in cancers, and the most targeted one is Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). Drugs such as erlotinib targets these receptors to slow growth for such tumors (Li et al., 2023).

3. **Apoptosis Regulators**: These are proteins that prevent programmed cell death. Drugs such as venetoclax induce the death of cancer cells by inhibiting these proteins (Ventura et al., 2006).

4. **DNA Repair Proteins**: These are targeted by drugs known as PARP inhibitors, which exploit a weakness in some cancer cells to initiate cell death (Richard et al., 2022; Bellio et al., 2019)

## From Target Identification to Drug Development

The use of proteins as drug targets is done in several ways:

1. **Target Identification**: With the help genomics and proteomics, numerous proteins are identified as being differentially expressed or mutated in cancer cells (Schenone et al., 2013).

2. **Target Validation**: Application of technologies like gene knockdown or overexpression studies confirms the contribution of the identified protein in cancer biology (Hughes et al., 2011).

3. **Drug Development**: Efforts put into the development of small molecules or antibodies that have the ability to bind to and modulate the target protein once validated (NCI, 2024).

## Challenges and Future Directions

There are challenges despite the high promise entailed by therapies targeted at proteins. Some potential targets are known to be "undruggable" because they lack suitable binding sites. Moreover, cancer cells might develop resistance to certain targeted therapies by mutating the target protein or activating substitute pathways (Shen et al., 2018).

However recent advances are expanding the horizons of protein-targeting drug discovery by:

1. **Structural Biology Advances**: Techniques such as cryoelectron microscopy, together with computational methods like AlphaFold, have provided insight into protein structure, enabling precise design of drugs (Callaway et al., 2020).

2. **Novel Approaches**: The useof Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras, or PROTACs, to expand the range of druggable proteins to previously unreachable targets (Sun et al., 2019;).

## Conclusion

Protein-targeted therapies lead cancer drug discovery. This approach enables tailoring treatments to individual tumor protein aberrations, bringing us closer to personalized cancer care.
